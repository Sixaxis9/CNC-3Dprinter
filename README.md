# CNC-3Dprinter

In this repository I have uploaded all the material related to a fresh design of a machine capable of working various type of materials, including wood and aluminum, with the nice addition of an extruder to use it as a 3D printer.

I have uploaded the Eagle project of the board. Below you can find a list of all the important feautures and the distinctive sign of this board. I also have uploaded the Gerber files for printing a PCB, in case you would like to power your 3D printer or CNC with my hardware.

A Wiki is available in the [apposite section](https://github.com/Sixaxis9/CNC-3Dprinter/wiki)

Below some pictures of the board:
